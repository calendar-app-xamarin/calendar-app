## Description

This is a calendar application for out Unit SIT 313 - Developing Client Server Web Applications.

For the purpose of our second Assignment we were required to design an application that would demonstrate all the working capabilities of Xamarin as a platform. So, for our second assignment we have decided to make a calendar application from scratch. The main motivation behind this the lack of any applications on play store that value user privacy and functionality in a single package.

## Compilation Instructions

- Open the application in Visual Studio and make sure you have a device plugged in(if using a real device.)
- Select a device from the top left corner right beside the play button.
- After selecting the device make press the play button to install the application onto your device.
